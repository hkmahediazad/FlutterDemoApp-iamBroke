# I_Am_Broke

As I said in my previous repository named " I Am Rich", I'm getting familiar with Flutter Widgets. This time i practiced the same thing by myself by assuming "I Am Broke"! Haha !
I now understand the widget tree and how to design a flutter interface.
In this demo flutter app I got familiar with MaterialApp, Scaffold Design, Network & Asset Image Widgets Tree, Color Widgets & App Icon embedding etc. It was pretty fun!
